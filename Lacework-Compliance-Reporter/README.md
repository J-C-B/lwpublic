## üîß Configuration

### API Configuration
The application supports two configuration methods:

#### Web Interface Configuration
- Configure credentials directly in the Streamlit sidebar
- Credentials are saved to `gui_config.json`
- Supports automatic loading from existing `config.json`

#### File-based Configuration
Create a `config.json` file in the project root:
```json
{
  "keyId": "YOUR_API_KEY_ID",
  "secret": "YOUR_API_SECRET",
  "account": "yourcompany.lacework.net",
  "url": "https://yourcompany.lacework.net"
}
```

### Report Options
- **Dataset**: AWS, Azure, GCP, or Kubernetes compliance
- **Time Range**: 24 hours, 7 days, or 30 days
- **Status Filter**: Defaults to NonCompliant (hidden in UI)
- **Severity Filter**: Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info (defaults to Critical and High)

## üìÅ File Management

### Generated Files
- **Base Reports**: `compliance_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_all.json`
- **Filtered Reports**: `compliance_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_[resource_group].json`
- **CSV Exports**: Corresponding `.csv` files for all reports

### File Operations
- **Browse**: View recent reports with creation dates and file sizes
- **Download**: Download reports in JSON or CSV format
- **Analyse**: View detailed metadata and generate filtered downloads
- **Delete**: Remove old reports to free up space

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### UI Performance
- **Issue**: UI lags with large files
- **Solution**: Give the application time to process large reports. The UI will become responsive once processing is complete.

#### Large File Loading Issues
- **Issue**: Streamlit fails to load or display large compliance reports
- **Solution**: Run Streamlit with increased message size limit:
  ```bash
  streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.maxMessageSize 500
  ```
  This increases the maximum message size to 500MB to handle large compliance reports.

#### API Authentication
- **Issue**: "Failed to authenticate with Lacework API"
- **Solution**: Verify your API credentials are correct and have the necessary permissions.

#### No Data Found
- **Issue**: Reports show 0 evaluations
- **Solution**: Try widening your search criteria (different time ranges, severity levels, or status filters).

#### Resource Groups Not Loading
- **Issue**: "No resource groups found"
- **Solution**: Generate a report first, then click "Get Resource Groups from Report".

### Performance Tips
- Use appropriate time ranges to limit data size
- Clear old reports regularly using the File Management section
- Use resource group filtering to focus on specific environments
- Allow time for large reports to process

## üîí Security Considerations

### API Credentials
- Store credentials securely and never commit them to version control
- Use environment variables or secure credential management in production
- Rotate API keys regularly

### Data Handling
- Reports contain sensitive compliance information
- Download files to secure locations
- Clean up temporary files when no longer needed

## üìà Performance Optimizations

### Caching
- File lists are cached for 30 seconds to improve performance
- Analysis results are cached per file to avoid reprocessing
- Session state persists configuration between page refreshes

### File Processing
- Optimized file size calculations
- Efficient CSV generation with helper functions
- Reduced redundant file system operations
